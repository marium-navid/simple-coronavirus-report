# Session 4 Outline

## Clean Up 

Wrap up all the commits from last week into 1 pull request (PR).

* Make PR
* Merge
* Pull from `master`
* Check out new branch
* Do this week's work on new branch

## Making a Report

* Now that you have functions, it should be easy to make a report comparing 5 places.
* A report isn't just charts or maps, it should also contain explanation, narrative, or conclusions, maybe even some captions. Use Markdown cells in the Jupyter Notebook to do so. 

**[Making a Report docs](../making_report.md)**

## Notebook Exercise

Run through `5-full-report.ipynb`
Demo using terminal to do `jupyter nbconvert` to convert a Jupyter Notebok into HTML or pdf.
Run through `automate.py` and `report.py`

If time permits:
Run through `A-county-charts.Rmd` and `iterate.R` and `D-sample-report.Rmd`.

## To Do 
1. Make progress on `5-full-report.ipynb` or create new notebook.
1. Make at least 1 more commit.
1. Merge in any open PRs, clean up your merged branches, clean up your repo.
1. Open a GitHub issue on MY repo, embed the URL of your report (HTML or PDF), and tag me. Your report should live on the `master` branch, because your PRs should be merged in.
