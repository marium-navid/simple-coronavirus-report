# Session 1 Outline

## Intro 

Introduce myself. Then everyone go around.
From everyone.

Ppl can turn cameras off after intro, since they might want to take notes, once we get through workshop arc. First sesh will be a lot of screensharing. 

**PAUSE FREQUENTLY AND ASK FOR QUESTIONS**

## Workshop arc (GitHub repo)

First session more lecture-driven.
Other sessions should have time dedicated to working within Jupyter notebooks.

## Why coronavirus report

New, uncertain, rapidly evolving situation.

The need for up-to-date information.

Web scraping in the beginning. Then as tests were deployed, it was uneven and cases were really subject to how many tests conducted.

As it stretches out, transition from figuring out what to measure, how to track, where are the hotspots, making sense of all the unknown, communicating to the public into **maintenance mode**. 

Coronavirus, by late spring, became one of the most visualized subject ever. Very drawn out over time. By late spring, there's general consensus of what are the visualizations you need to monitor what's happening, there were public health standards and guidance around reopning, what you would track to determine your community transmission levels.

Seen various examples in articles, public health agencies, social media etc. We've seen a lot, now let's do a very real-world exercise to implementing this as a report. 

When I started this for Mayor's office, we did a lot of heavy lifting in terms of writing the code, setting up a pipeline, etc. In our mind, if we could set up a fairly automated process, even if it was just for a couple months, that would be worthwhile.

The Mayor's office, for whatever reason, did not want to use any of these tools, but instead stuck with Google Sheets updated manually. No one could have predicted how long this has lasted, but there have been at least 2 separate occasions since the summer when they've come back to ask for help automating some of their code.

Meanwhile, stuff we set up has been sending out daily emails since June, with very little work daily to maintain, and occasionally there will be more major changes to reflect changes in public health guidance.


## Introduce all the programs needed (Getting Started)

Run through demo of what everyone needs to have set up, and what role each program/application/tool plays in our data science ecosystem. Our stack is Python-based, but RStudio is also made available, and there are working examples in the repo.

## Screen share and walk through various programs


## Future sessions: dedicated time to do notebook, can use breakout rooms to discuss
